# UserScript-scripts
My personal scripts for UserScript


## [Mangadex Search](https://github.com/victoravtr/UserScript-scripts/blob/main/scripts/mangadex_search.js)
```
Script to hide mangas with status like  ["Dropped", "Plan To Read", "Completed"] in Search tab
```

## [Primevideo Search](https://github.com/victoravtr/UserScript-scripts/blob/main/scripts/primevideo_search.js)
```
Script to hide non-free movies and series from search results. 
It's executed every time the DOM is changed so use it with care, can result in worse performance.
